## Algorithms and Data Structures implemented in python3

### Linked List
When we want to work with an unknown number of data values, we use a linked list data structure to organize that data. The linked list is a linear data structure that contains a sequence of elements such that each element links to its next element in the sequence. Each element in a linked list is called "Node".
### Tree
A tree is a very popular non-linear data structure used in a wide range of applications.
 
### Graph
Graph is a non-linear data structure. It contains a set of points known as nodes (or vertices) and a set of links known as edges (or Arcs). Here edges are used to connect the vertices.
